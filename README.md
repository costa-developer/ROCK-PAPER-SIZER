## Project Title: Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project implements a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game with an advanced twist: the computer opponent uses machine learning to learn your playing patterns. The goal is to build a bot that can consistently win against a variety of opponents, including bots that play randomly, sequentially, or even use their own machine learning models.
